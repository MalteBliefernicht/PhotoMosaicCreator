# PhotoMosaicCreator

The main app is a photo mosaic creator. It takes a template picture and a folder of source pictures in different colors to create the mosaic.
The quality of the mosaic heavily depends on the source pictures. The process is pretty slow and the results are not that great.

The second app can be used to prepare pictures for the main app by resizing and cropping pictures to the desired dimensions.
Unfortunately the main app only works with up to approximately 100 source pictures.

This project was my first time working with images. Initialy it was a terminal app that I later gave a GUI. 
Thats why the core program is just kind of shoved in there.
